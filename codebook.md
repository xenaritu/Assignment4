**INTRODUCTION**

We were provided data for experiments  carried out with a group of 30 subjects within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each subject performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.

For each of the variable described above, I have calculated the mean of the measurement for each person for each activity that he performed.

**Type of variables**

1. xtBodyAcc-XYZ
2. tGravityAcc-XYZ
3. tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
4. tBodyGyro-XYZ
5. tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
6. tBodyAccMag
7. tGravityAccMag
8. tBodyAccJerkMag
9. tBodyGyroMag
10.tBodyGyroJerkMag
11. fBodyAcc-XYZ
12. fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
13. fBodyGyro-XYZ
14. fBodyAccMag
15. fBodyAccJerkMag
16. fBodyGyroMag
17. fBodyGyroJerkMag

**Description of the measurements taken**

prefix 't' to denote time 
prefix 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals

*tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ* 

acceleration signal separated into body and gravity acceleration signals

*tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ*

the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals

*tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag*

magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm 

*fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag* 

Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the signals
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

1. mean: Mean value
2. std:  Standard deviation
